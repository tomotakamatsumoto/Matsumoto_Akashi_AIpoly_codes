/*The first line is a comment which will be read and output 
into the fsim output file. dont add any comments to the end of the first line
whatever comes before the first end of line is assumed to be a comment
The order of the control file items is significant. DONT CHANGE ORDER. if you
want to change order then change the getCtlFile function as well*/
